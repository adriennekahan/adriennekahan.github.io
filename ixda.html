					<h3>Opportunity</h3>
					<p>How can we increase the value of a conference goer's experience? What aspects of the conference app can be enhanced to engage attendees?</p>
					
					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p>A mobile app that gives the user the information and ability to create a schedule according to their interests. Our solution facilitates communications, scheduling and referencing before, after and during the conference.</p>
					
					<h3>Role</h3>
					<p>My team of three collaborated on most steps of the design process. I lead user research and testing, information architecture and global navigation design.</p>

		            <h3>Process Overview</h3>
		            <p>The Interaction Design Association (IxDA) hosts a 3-day design conference that features a busy schedule of talks and events. The conference is an opportunity for learning and networking. </p>
		            <p>My team analyzed the previous version of the app and conducted user research to learn how to better address user needs. We used the data to focus on providing users with the information they need to feel satisfied with their conference experience.

		            <h3>Why do users attend conferences? What are their painpoints?</h3>
		            
		            <h5>Discovery methods: screener, user interview</h5>
		            <p>An open-ended screener allowed my team to gather data from a diverse group of conference goers. In follow-up interviews we focused on usersâ€™ experiences with conference apps, general frustrations / high points at the conference, and goals relating to the conference.</p>
		            <h5>Key Findings</h5>
		            <p>As a team, we mapped data points and synthesized our findings:</p>
		            <li><p>I need to know as much as possible about my choices so I can make the best use of my time</p></li>
		            <li><p> am more confident when I have determined my schedule</p></li>
		            <li><p>I benefit from being part of a community of my peers</p></li>
		            <li><p>I need to know how to get to where I want to go</p></li>
		            <li><p>I learn better when I review information more than once</p></li>

	            	<h3>Design</h3>
	            	<p>The prototype gives users detailed information on talk they can review or view if they were unable to make the talk at the conference. Users can create a personalized schedule and see room locations and capacities.

		            <h3>Validation through usability testing</h3>
		            <p>All users tested completed the task sequence with little difficulty. We made a few adjustments to the design: rearranged buttons to adhere to conventions, highlighted CTAs for quicker navigation, and added location services to the venue map.</p>
		            <h3>In a world of endless iterations...</h3>
		            <p>We would test a higher fidelity prototype with more sophisticated interactions (e.g. communication with external calendar, sliding menu and "back to top" on longer pages). These improvements would further improve clarity and user delight. We would also improve user control with more back buttons.
					<h3>Results and Learning</h3>
					<p>We were successfully able to create a tool that achieved the intended functions! Throughout the design process, I was very focused on sticking to user data and needs, which I think kept me from exploring wilder options early on. This led to the creation of a solid design with an opportunity for more user delight.</p>
